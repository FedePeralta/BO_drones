# Bayesian Optimization ASV system

Bayesian Optimization-based multi Autonomous Surface Vehicle system for Environmental Monitoring.

This repository corresponds to the code written for works [1] and [2] in Python 3.8.4. Consists on a system-based approach for defining surface vehicles in charge of efficiently measuring water quality profiles of lakes and lagoons. 

## Installation

Please install the following python libraries before use:

```commandline
pip install matplotlib skopt sklearn numpy json paho-mqtt pyyaml deap
```

## Use

The code includes an [example folder](bin/Examples) where numerous example of use are found.

## Citing

Please cite the work as [1] or [2], if applicable.
